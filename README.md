This `README.md` serves as the landing page for our project and is updated as we add [code](https://github.com/cse110-sp23-group5/cse110-sp23-group5/tree/main/source), tests, [documentation](https://github.com/cse110-sp23-group5/cse110-sp23-group5/tree/main/admin) and other important artifacts.
We merge our `dev` branch into `main` weekly after discussing our progress and agreeing to go ahead and merge.
