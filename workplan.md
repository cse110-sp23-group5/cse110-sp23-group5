## Work Planning Document
### Week 5
#### Assigned Groups
- Backend: Pranav, Leo, Matthew
- Frontend: Harry, Helen, Aaron
- Design: Andrew, Fangyu
- Testing: Stephen, Leo

#### Format of Our Sprints
- We will do three sprints (Week 6, Week 8, Week 10)
- We will do standup meetings in person after class on Monday (w2m)
- We will spend the time in between sprint doing retrospecs, and planning
- For the most part, we will assign tasks to individuals, but the first sprint will be mostly pair programming

#### Tasks For Next Meeting
- Come up with two potential issues/features to add to this project (everyone)
- Get ready to define sprint structure once we have a more concrete plan on steps forward.
- Check our CI/CD Pipeline and look to improve it
- Discuss Guidelines for Pushing Features and Code Reviews
- Pair Program for the first Sprint, in order to better acclimate people to the stack

#### Next Meeting - General Decisions 
- Branch Protection System has been added
- A seperate branch will be added for each issue, it will get pushed to main
- Two people will get asked to code review but only one will have to approve before it gets pushed

#### Task Assignments
- Design: create drawings for the buttons we discussed adding in meeting (go button, calendar) as well as a design for the saved fortunes page
- Frontend: variety of UI fixes mentioned in the UI/UX Overhaul issue
- Backend: Find an API to grab fortunes rather than random generation
- Testing: Set up CI/CD Pipeline, which breaks when you create a fork
